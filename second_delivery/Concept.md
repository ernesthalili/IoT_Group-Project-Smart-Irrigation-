# Smart Irrigation

## Definition 
The product created is a Smart Irrigation System for plants using Temperature, air humidity, soil humidity sensors and it is connected to the Internet. The system provides the user with automatic actions through 2 actuators. In every case, there is a display showing the level of the soil humidity using colours to show the state of the system. If the level of humidity is high enough, we show the value using a green value, for lower values we use orange colour and for states where the humidity level is very low, the value is read. When the system is in danger state, a pump is used to irrigate water.

## Problem
In every house, everyday, liters of water are wasted for any kind of use: dishwashers, personal hygiene, washing machine, irrigating. The problem we are focusing on is the one related to irrigating. People waste on an average 25 liters of water everyday only for irrigating purposes.

## Possible solution
Why using an IoT system?
An IoT solution can prevent the waste by controlling with accurate sensors the quantity of water needed. This will be completely autonomous and will avoid any external action for the user. This system could be perfect for people that live in apartments, that can irrigate their plants that are located on the balcony without any stress.
By doing this the waste of water will be reduced up to 70% since the water will be given only if required.
